Hi, 

My name is Pallavi Rawat. Full time software developer, and consultant at times.
Been messing around with computers since 2011. Trying to good software these days.

Big time biking (bicyling) fan and wannabe animator. 
In my free time I like to research on some history of some random thing which piqued my recent interest.
I also believe I have a good sense of humor which might also be dark for some folks.
