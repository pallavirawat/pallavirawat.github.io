So after quite hit and trials the website is up. Phew.

Now we shall do more play around! 

`kotlin`

simple example code for this first markdown

{% highlight kotlin %}
fun main(){
    println("since everything starts with hello")
}
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Kotlin docs][kotlin-docs] for more info on how to write kotlin.
